## Using WooCommerce as headless eCommerce

WARNING: Headless flow is supported only for integration modes `hostedPayPage` and `standalone`. IFrame flow is not supported!

This section is for developers using WooCommerce as headless eCommerce, having separated frontend application communicating with WooCommerce via REST API/GraphQL.

Since version 1.3.0, an integration enables obtaining data to build a redirection form via REST API. It provides `POST` endpoint on the following URI: `https://your-wordpress-instance.local/wp-json/mmb-gateway/v1/redirect-data` where `https://your-wordpress-instance.local` is as base URL of your Wordpress instance. An endpoint expects JSON payload with a field called `order_key` containing an order key of WooCommerce order. Example TypeScript client:

```ts
type EServiceEndpointPayload = {
  order_key: string;
};

type EServiceEndpointResponse = {
  token: string,
  merchantId: string,
  integrationMode: "hostedPayPage" | "standalone",
  cashierUrl: string,
  automaticForm: boolean
};

type EServiceEndpointError = {
  code: string,
  message: string,
  data: {
    status: number,
    [key: string]: any
  },
}

const baseURL = "http://localhost:8888";
const getEServiceRedirectData = async (payload: EServiceEndpointPayload): Promise<EServiceEndpointResponse> => {
  const endpointUrl = new URL("wp-json/mmb-gateway/v1/redirect-data", baseURL);
  const response = await fetch(endpointUrl, {
    headers: {
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(payload),
  });

  if (!response.ok || response.status === 204) {
    const error = await response.json() as EServiceEndpointError;
    throw new Error(error.message);
  }
  return await response.json() as EServiceEndpointResponse;
};
```

Example usage:

```ts
// Inside async function
try {
  const responseBody = await getEServiceRedirectData({
    order_key: 'wc_order_xyz123'
  });
  responseBody; // Here I have everything!
} catch (err: unknown) {
  console.error((err as Error).message);
}
```

### Possible errors

#### No payload found

Occurs if the developer didn't attach request's body.

```json
{
  "code": "no_payload",
  "message": "No payload found",
  "data": {
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

#### No order key provided

Occurs if the developer didn't attach `order_key` inside request's body.

```json
{
  "code": "no_order_key",
  "message": "No order key provided",
  "data": {
    "status": 400
  }
}
```

#### No order found for provided key

Occurs if an order for provided `order_key` doesn't exist.

```json
{
  "code": "no_order",
  "message": "No order found for provided key",
  "data": {
    "status": 404
  }
}
```

#### Invalid order

Occurs if found `order_id` for provided `order_key` but for some reason couldn't find an order with this ID. It means that something might be broken in order's structure or that order is broken.

```json
{
  "code": "invalid_order",
  "message": "Order not found",
  "data": {
    "status": 500
  }
}
```

#### Already paid

Occurs if an order is already paid.

```json
{
  "code": "already_paid",
  "message": "Already paid",
  "data": {
    "status": 204
  }
}
```
